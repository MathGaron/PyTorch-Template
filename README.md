# PyTorch-Template
Simple PyTorch template utility to train torch model from Python.

## Dependencies
- [Pytorch](https://github.com/hughperkins/pytorch)
- [Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) with some lua modules

## Goal
Pytorch is a cool python wrapper over lua for torch, it can also be used to import homemade lua class in python which is my favorite usecase.
This is a simple base class for training most kind of networks from python and setup a project as fast as possible.
